## AI and ML

Are you interested in understanding core algorithms and mathematics underlying Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning? Would you like to implement 
projects that explore these technologies, rather than repeat what others have done (with no insights)? Keen on writing articles and building up your portfolio?

Join AlgoAsylum for an intensive exploration of these areas, and learn what AI and ML are truly about!

---
We will select from the following topics:
* KNN, Decision Trees
* Linear regression
* Linear classifiers
* Neural Networks
* Support Vector Machines
* Gaussian Mixture Models
* Hidden Markov Models

Coverage (depth) depends on you!

---

Implementations will be in Python using PyTorch
