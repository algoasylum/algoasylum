## 2022 Semester 1

Companies will soon be coming to campus to select students for internships.
Are you ready?

AlgoAsylum is starting a course on **Algorithms, Data Structures and Programming**.
We cover a variety of topics from strings, arrays, dictionaries, linked lists, trees and graphs. This is not for beginners - it is designed for people who know the basics and are gearing up for the interview. 

<br>*Time*: 40 hours lectures + 80 hours practical + an equal amount of time on your own
<br>*Cost*: Rs 20,000 + GST

Topics:
* Data Structures:
  - Arrays: traversals, [searching](https://shrirang.karandikar.org/2021/07/12/aoc-day-01/)
  - Linked lists: building, adding and removing data, traversals, comparison with arrays
  - Trees: definition and properties, binary and n-ary trees, pre-, post- and in-order traversals, balanced trees, BST
  - Graphs: properties, breadth first and depth first searches, shortest paths, applications
* Algorithms (in addition to the ones above)
  - Sorting and searching: bounds, applications, combinations
  - Divide and conquer: The two types
  - Greedy Algorithms: The greedy paradigm, examples such as merge and quicksort, Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm. How to recognize opportunities and applications
  - Dynamic Programming: The dynamic programming paradigm, the different dimensions of DP and examples of each. How to define subproblems and combine their solutions
* Theoretical CS: NP Completeness
* Programming: 
  - The general approach to addressing a programming problem
  - Defining the data structure
  - Defining the code layout
  - Implementation
  - Evaluating for correctness
  - Evaluating performance
  - Analysis

Coverage (depth) depends on you!

Are you interested in a career in Data Science? Is your final year project going to be in the exciting fields of AI and ML? Ever wonder how these technologies are changing the world?

The **Python and Data Science** course is for you.
We assume significant familiarity with basic programming constructs (loops, functions, etc.). We will learn how to develop software in Python and focus on libraries that are used for data analysis and visualisation. You will do a capstone project to showcase your skills.

<br>*Time*: 40 hours lectures + 80 hours practical + an equal amount of time on your own
<br>*Cost*: Rs 25,000 + GST

---
Topics:
* Python: language constructs, datatypes, functions, generators, ...
* Libraries: Logging, NumPy, Pandas, MatPlotLib, ScikitLearn
* Exploratory Data Analysis: ingestion, cleaning, visualization
* Classification and Regression: training models, making predictions and analyzing the results
