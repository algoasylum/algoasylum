Perceptrons and SVMs, [Anushka Desai](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anushka-desai-140b21259?) and [Sharayu Kondobhairy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharayu-kondubhairy/)

The project involved exploring the Perceptron Learning Algorithm, with a focus on its mathematical proof of convergence and visualization. The work extended 
to an in-depth analysis of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and kernel methods, particularly polynomial and RBF kernels. The study included investigating 
their mathematical foundations and analyzing their behavior on various datasets.

CNN to DNN Translator, [Nandini Kanawade](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nandini-kanawade-981808231)

Study the relationship and impact between convolutional layers and
dense layers. The aim is to understand how these two types of layers contribute to feature
extraction and classification tasks and leverage their unique strengths to create a translator model 
that combines the feature extraction power of convolutional layers with the computational efficiency and simplicity of dense layers.
